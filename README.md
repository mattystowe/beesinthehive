# Bees in the Hive
A simple command line single player game with bees, hives and stuff. Rules of the task can be found in the [Game Specifications](docs/Specification.md).

You should probably be playing something else, like SmashBros or something, and less to do with those picnic spoiling critters ;-)

**wait there's more**

The bees now have their own Hive leaderboard.
